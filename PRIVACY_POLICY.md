## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **Smart Seating** ("the App", "we", "us", or "our"). Smart Seating is a mobile application that helps bus passengers find the shadiest seat based on real-time sun position calculations for their route and departure time.

This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information. By using Smart Seating, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Location Data (Optional)

When you tap the **"Use My Location"** button on the Plan Trip screen, the App requests access to your device's precise GPS location. This location is used **solely** to identify the nearest city name to pre-fill your origin field.

- Location data is processed **entirely on your device**.
- It is **never transmitted** to any external server or third party.
- It is **not stored** beyond the current app session.
- You can deny location permission and type your origin manually at any time.

### 2.2 User Preferences (Local Storage)

The App stores the following data **locally on your device** using the device's built-in secure storage (`SharedPreferences`):

| Data | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Language preference (`en` or `bn`) | Remember your chosen language between sessions |
| Onboarding completion status | Avoid showing the intro screen on subsequent launches |

This data never leaves your device and is not linked to any personal identity.

### 2.3 Data We Do NOT Collect

We do **not** collect:

- Names, email addresses, or any account information
- Precise or historical location trails
- Route history or travel patterns sent to a server
- Device identifiers (IMEI, advertising ID, etc.)
- Crash reports or analytics
- Payment information

---

## 3. How We Use Information

| Information | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| GPS location (if granted) | Identify nearest city for the origin field — processed on-device only |
| Language preference | Display the app in your chosen language |
| Onboarding status | Provide a smooth first-launch experience |

We do **not** use your information for advertising, profiling, or any purpose beyond operating the core app features.

---

## 4. Sun Calculation & Route Data

The sun position and shade-side calculations performed by Smart Seating are done entirely using **on-device algorithms** based on publicly available solar geometry formulas. No route or trip data is sent to any server.

---

## 5. Third-Party Services

Smart Seating uses the following third-party libraries, all of which operate entirely on-device:

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Google Fonts (Poppins) | Typography — font files are bundled with the app |
| Geolocator | Accesses device GPS hardware when permission is granted |
| Provider | On-device state management |
| SharedPreferences | Local data storage |

None of these libraries receive personally identifiable information through our App.

---

## 6. Permissions

| Permission | Platform | Reason |
|------------|----------|--------|
| `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` | Android | GPS for nearest-city lookup (optional feature) |
| `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` | Android | Fallback GPS accuracy |
| `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` | iOS | GPS for nearest-city lookup (optional feature) |

You may revoke location permission at any time through your device's Settings → Apps → Smart Seating → Permissions.

---

## 7. Data Retention

Since all data is stored locally on your device, **you control retention entirely**:

- Uninstalling the App deletes all stored preferences.
- Clearing app data through device settings removes all local storage.

We hold no copies of your data on any server.

---

## 8. Children's Privacy

Smart Seating does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. The App does not contain content directed at children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us immediately.

---

## 9. Data Security

All data processed by Smart Seating remains on your device. We implement no server-side storage, so there is no risk of a server-side data breach affecting your personal information.

---

## 10. Your Rights

Because we do not collect or store personal data on external servers, most data subject rights (access, deletion, portability) are exercised directly on your device by managing the App's local storage or uninstalling the App.

If you have questions or concerns, please contact us at the address below.

## 11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. For significant changes, we will provide an in-app notification.
