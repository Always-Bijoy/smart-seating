## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, or using the **Smart Seating** mobile application ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.

These Terms apply to all users of the App on Android and iOS platforms.

---

## 2. Description of the Service

Smart Seating is a free mobile application that:

- Calculates the position of the sun relative to a bus route and departure time.
- Recommends which side of the bus (left or right) will be in shade during your journey.
- Displays a real-time sun tracker compass for active trips.
- Supports English and Bengali (বাংলা) languages.

The App uses publicly available solar geometry algorithms and optional device GPS to provide these recommendations. It does **not** provide transportation booking, ticketing, or live traffic data.

---

## 3. Eligibility

The App may be used by anyone. There is no account registration or age gate. Parents and guardians are responsible for supervising use by minors.

---

## 4. License to Use

We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use Smart Seating on your personal device solely for personal, non-commercial use in accordance with these Terms.

You may **not**:

- Copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the App.
- Reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of the App.
- Use the App for any unlawful or harmful purpose.
- Remove any copyright or proprietary notices from the App.

---

## 5. Accuracy of Sun & Shade Calculations

Smart Seating provides **estimated recommendations** based on solar position calculations. The accuracy of recommendations depends on:

- The accuracy of your entered origin and destination cities.
- Your actual departure time.
- Weather conditions (clouds, overcast skies are not factored in).
- Actual road curvature and bus route heading, which may differ from the straight-line bearing used in calculations.

**The App's recommendations are informational only.** We do not guarantee that the recommended seat will always be in shade. Actual sun exposure may vary based on real-world conditions outside our control.

---

## 6. Location Services

The App may request access to your device's GPS location solely to identify your nearest city for the "Origin" field. This is an optional convenience feature. You may deny location access and enter your origin manually.

Location data is:
- Processed entirely on your device.
- Never stored or transmitted externally.
- Used only for the duration of the active lookup.

## 7. Intellectual Property

All content in Smart Seating — including but not limited to the name, logo, design, code, algorithms, and text — is the intellectual property of the developer and is protected by applicable copyright and intellectual property laws.

You acknowledge that no title or ownership of intellectual property is transferred to you through use of the App.
